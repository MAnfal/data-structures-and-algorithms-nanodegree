For this problem we are going to use the frequency trick. We will create an array with the frequency value map of each number from 0, 1 and 2
and then we are going to use this to generate a brand new list with every number multiplied by the number of it's frequency. This trick is possible 
because we know we are only dealing with 3 consecutive numbers.
