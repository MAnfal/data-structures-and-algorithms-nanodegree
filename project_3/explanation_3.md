We are going to leverage merge sort here. We are going to first sort the entire given array into descending order using merge sort then
concat all even numbers in 1 number and odd numbers in the other. Their sum will be the maximum possible answer.

Time complexity is O(nlog n) + O(n) or O(nlog n) and space complexity of this problem is O(n)
